## Example RoomDB Project

This Android application demonstrates data persistence and basic display of text data using **Room Database**. Users can add, display, and delete data entries containing a title and content.

## Key Features
- Add new data entries by inputting a title and content.
- Display all saved data in a dynamic layout.
- Delete individual data entries.
- Automatically show the date and time each entry was added.
- Basic UI interactions and soft keyboard handling.

## Libraries and Dependencies
This project uses the following Android libraries:
- **Room Database**: Part of Android Jetpack for local data storage.
- **Coroutines**: Manages background tasks (data insertion, retrieval, deletion) efficiently without blocking the UI thread.
- **View Binding**: Simplifies view access and interaction.

## Project Structure

### 1. `MainActivity.kt`
Handles the following tasks:
- Initializes the Room database.
- Inserts new items into the database when the user clicks the "Insert" button.
- Displays all stored items when the activity is created.
- Deletes individual items when the "Delete" button associated with an item is clicked.

### 2. `AppDatabase.kt`
Defines the database structure, including:
- **DataEntity**: Represents each row in the table with columns `id`, `title`, `content`, and `date`.
- **DataDao**: Data Access Object (DAO) that defines methods for interacting with the database, including `insert`, `selectAll`, and `deleteById`.

### 3. `DataEntity.kt`
A data class representing the table structure used in the Room database, with the following fields:
- `id`: Automatically generated primary key.
- `title`: String containing the title of the entry.
- `content`: String containing the content of the entry.
- `date`: String representing the date and time the entry was added.

### 4. `ActivityMainBinding`
Automatically generated by **View Binding** and links the views declared in `activity_main.xml` to the Kotlin code.

## Usage Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/example_roomdb.git
    ```

2. Open the project in Android Studio.

3. Build and run the project on an emulator or a physical device with **Android API Level 26 (Oreo)** or higher.

4. Once the app is running:
   - Enter a title and content in each field.
   - Click the **Insert** button to save the data to the Room database.
   - The saved data will display below the input fields.
   - To delete an entry, click the **Delete** button associated with it.

## Room Database Setup

The Room database in this project is initialized as a singleton using the `Room.databaseBuilder()` method. The `DataDao` interface defines SQL operations for inserting, querying, and deleting data.

```kotlin
appDatabase = Room.databaseBuilder(
    applicationContext,
    AppDatabase::class.java, "example-room-db"
).build()
```

## Requirements
- Android Studio Flamingo or later.
- JDK 17 or higher.
- Android API Level 26 (Oreo) or higher.
